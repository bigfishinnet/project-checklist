	3. Make sure you have a list of items that need to be complete din a SPRINT
	4. Ensure the items are relevant and focused
	5. Break it down into items
	6. REMEMBER you are not personally responsible for blockers the PROJECT is.
	7. Work through the list of items based on timescales you have available
	8. Qualify why you are doing the SPIKE and the benefits to the project

	10. Set reasonable timescales for your spike

NOTES: Go to scrum master for support and tell them that you were unable to complete tasks due to external influences. Don't be scared to ask a team member for assistance if you are still stuck on a task.
